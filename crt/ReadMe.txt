This "crt" is my own variation of "LIBCTINY" which I read about in a January 2001
MSDN Magazine article by Matt Pietrek. The idea is to create the bare minimum of
what's needed to compile a console or Win32 x86/C app to avoid using the bloated CRT
included with Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2005 by default. It was an educational and
challenging experience and hope it proves useful to someone else to continue.
